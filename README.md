# audiovisio - build a self-playing presentation

## intro

Audiovisio is a experimental tool to create HTML based presentations from full image slides for which each slide has its own audio file.
Using a simple configuration file, you specify the title and order of each slide.
The audiovisio tool will generate all the webpage resources such that you can host the standalone presentation.

## usage

The example configuration below is taken from the test folder.
There are 2 slides, 4 images and 2 audio files.
The audio files are created using Google Text to Speech (see [gspeech](https://github.com/emicklei/gspeech)).

### generate

    audiovisio -c test.yaml -o test.html

```
title: Test - Episode One
header: Episode One
footer: More like this
button-start-title: Start 

# transition in milliseconds
# can be overridden per slide
pause-before-audio: 500
pause-after-audio: 500

leader:
